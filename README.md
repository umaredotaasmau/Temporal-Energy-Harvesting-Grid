# Decentralized Temporal Energy Harvesting Grid

> Harnessing the fundamental energy of spacetime through distributed blockchain contracts

## Overview

The Decentralized Temporal Energy Harvesting Grid (DTEHG) represents a revolutionary approach to energy production by tapping into the fundamental fabric of spacetime itself. By leveraging blockchain technology, we've created a system that can extract, process, and distribute energy derived from temporal fluctuations across a decentralized network.

## Core Components

### 1. Chronon Capture Contract

The Chronon Capture Contract (CCC) is the foundation of our system, designed to extract energy from the flow of time itself. Using quantum temporal resonators, the contract:

- Establishes quantum entanglement with chronon particles
- Harvests energy from temporal momentum
- Converts chronon decay into usable energy packets
- Maintains precise temporal calibration to prevent leakage

#### Technical Specifications
- Chronon extraction efficiency: 0.87 zeptowatts per cubic nanometer
- Temporal resolution: 0.032 planck-time units
- Quantum coherence maintenance: 99.7%

### 2. Temporal Anomaly Detection Contract

The Temporal Anomaly Detection (TAD) contract continuously scans spacetime for natural fluctuations and distortions that can be leveraged for enhanced energy extraction:

- Identifies micro-wormholes, time dilation zones, and causal echo chambers
- Deploys targeted chronon harvesters to anomalous regions
- Classifies anomalies by stability, yield potential, and paradox risk
- Creates a distributed ledger of temporal topology across the network

#### Technical Specifications
- Anomaly detection sensitivity: 10^-42 seconds of deviation
- False positive rate: <0.002%
- Scan radius: 500 meter sphere around each node

### 3. Paradox Prevention Contract

The Paradox Prevention Contract (PPC) is our critical safety system that ensures energy extraction doesn't disrupt the causal fabric of spacetime:

- Monitors causality violations in real-time
- Implements automatic shutdown protocols for dangerous extraction patterns
- Maintains temporal integrity through quantum firewall technology
- Deploys causal stabilizers to regions of excessive extraction

#### Technical Specifications
- Paradox risk threshold: 0.0000001% per extraction cycle
- Temporal branch prediction accuracy: 99.98%
- Emergency shutdown response time: 0.3 nanoseconds
- Causal integrity verification: 256-bit quantum hash

### 4. Temporal Energy Distribution Contract

The Temporal Energy Distribution (TED) contract manages the fair and efficient allocation of harvested temporal energy:

- Routes energy across the network based on smart contract arrangements
- Compensates node operators based on energy contribution
- Implements time-sharded distribution to maximize efficiency
- Maintains temporal energy reserves for grid stability

#### Technical Specifications
- Distribution efficiency: 99.3%
- Smart contract execution time: 1.2 milliseconds
- Node reward calculation method: Proof of Temporal Stake (PoTS)
- Network capacity: 42 terawatt-hours of temporal energy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Quantum-compatible hardware with temporal sensitivity modules
- Chronon-stabilized cooling system
- Minimum 1 petaFLOP processing capacity
- Causal isolation chamber (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/temporal-grid/dtehg.git
```

2. Install the quantum dependencies:
```
npm install --quantum-depth=full
```

3. Initialize your node's temporal anchor:
```
./initialize-anchor.sh --coordinates="your-spacetime-coordinates"
```

4. Register your node with the network:
```
./register-node.js --capacity="your-processing-capacity" --stability="your-temporal-stability-rating"
```

5. Start your local chronon harvester:
```
npm run start-harvester
```

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Please read carefully before operating the system** ⚠️

- Never exceed recommended extraction rates
- Maintain minimum 2-meter separation between chronon harvesters
- Do not operate multiple nodes in areas with known temporal instability
- If you experience déjà vu, discontinue use and contact support immediately
- Always engage paradox prevention protocols before harvesting
- Keep children and pets away from active temporal extraction zones
